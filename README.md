## GET OFF MY LAWN - 3350 project
2D scavenger hunt game

*Daisy Cortez | Nathaly Leon | Tiara Smith | Janneth Guarcas Garcia*

### Overview: 
You are an animal who wanders into a neighborhood and you
see multiple items scattered around and you try to collect as many as you
can. However, for every item you collect another inhabitant joins the chase
and once you get caught it is game over!

*Update: We made modifications to our goals and the game.*

### Gameplay: 
* You have to race against the clock! You are given 36 seconds to collect as much as you can!
* You pick up the fish or the small red apple or get points!
* Picking up the red apple gives you a trail, reshuffles where the fish goes, and spawns new apple!
* Picking up the fish makes you go faster and gives bonus points!!!
